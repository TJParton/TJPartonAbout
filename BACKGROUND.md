## Hello, here is some info about me!

My name is TJ Parton and I am 19 years old.

## My Family
1. My sister, Makayla
1. My Dad, Tim
1. My Mom, Kara
1. My Dog, Thor
1. My Cat, Mouse

I have a very close relationship with my family and love to do aything with them even simple things.

## Early Life

As a baby I was always happy and smiling and was **very chubby**. Which is surprising due to the fact that I was born about 3 weeks early. Growing up I was always the smallest in my class, which led the doctors to believe that I had a *low-growth hormone*. Although, I was smaller as a child I did not let that get in my way and used humor to make friends. When I was seven my parents decided that I should play a sport, and I decided to try wrestling. I believe that wrestling is a huge reason that I am the person I am today, even though I generally disliked the sport. I ended up wrestling for 9 years before I decided that I no longer wanted to continue pursuing it. Overall, I had a wonderful childhood fueled by a loving family, and have had many experiences and opportunities throughout my life that I am very thankful for.  

## Currently 

As of now I am attending my first year at **The University Of Missouri**(Mizzou). At school I am pursuing a career in Cyber Security and am enjoying my time here thankful for the opportunities I have been given.
